                    <p class="text-base xl:text-xl lg:text-xl md:text-lg sm:text-base">Sri Lanka Railways, known locally as "Sri Lanka Rail," boasts a rich history dating back to the colonial era. Established in 1864 with the opening of the main line from Colombo to Ambepussa, the railway network was initially designed to facilitate the transportation of coffee and later tea from the central highlands to the port of Colombo. Over the decades, the railway network expanded, connecting major cities and towns across the island. Today, it serves as a vital mode of transport for both passengers and freight, symbolizing a blend of historical significance and modern utility.</p>
